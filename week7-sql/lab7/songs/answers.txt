The average valence of the songs in the database is 0.48, the average danceability is 0.71 and the average energy is 0.66.
I would say that this means that the hipotetical listener of this songs has a Purple Aura because of the high energy and danceability.

It is possible that this is not an accurate way to calculate the aura of a person because the average should take
into account the number of times each song was played.
