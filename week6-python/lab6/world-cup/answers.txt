Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

With a small number of simulations there were a lot of variations in the results with each run. With
more than 1000 simulations teh results didn't change a lot in the first places but there were some
signifficant changes in the teams that had lower probabilities.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would consider that 10000 simulations is a good number because there aren't any significant changes
in the results with more simulations and they take a lot more time to run. Higher
numbers of simulations take significantly more time and the results are not very different.
