            <h2 class="centered">Giuseppe Verdi</h2>
            <p id="resumen">
                Verdi was a famous Italian composer of opera in the 19th century. He wrote some of the most popular and performed 
                operas in the world, such as La traviata, Aida, and Otello. He was also a patriot who supported the unification 
                of Italy and became a symbol of the Risorgimento movement. He was born in a small village near Busseto in 1813 and 
                received his musical education with the help of a local patron. He married Margherita Barezzi, the daughter of his 
                patron, in 1836, but lost both her and their two children by 1840. He then devoted himself to composing operas, 
                chieving his first great success with Nabucco in 1842. He continued to write operas for the next 50 years, creating 
                masterpieces that explored themes such as love, betrayal, revenge, freedom, and justice. He also composed a Requiem 
                Mass in memory of the poet Alessandro Manzoni and four sacred pieces for choir and orchestra. He died in Milan in 1901
                 at the age of 87.

                        La traviata is divided into three acts, each with several scenes. 
                    The first act takes place in a Parisian salon, where Violetta, a courtesan, 
                    is hosting a party. She meets Alfredo, a young man who has been secretly 
                    in love with her for a year. He confesses his feelings to her and she is 
                    touched by his sincerity. She gives him a camellia and tells him to return 
                    when it wilts. After the guests leave, Violetta reflects on her life of pleasure 
                    and freedom, but also feels a new attraction to Alfredo.

                        The second act is set in a country house near Paris, where Violetta
                    and Alfredo have been living happily for several months. Alfredo 
                    learns from his friend Gastone that Violetta has been selling her jewels 
                    to pay for their expenses. He decides to go to Paris to settle their debts. 
                    Meanwhile, Violetta receives an unexpected visit from Alfredo’s father, 
                    Giorgio Germont, who asks her to leave Alfredo for the sake of his family’s 
                    honor and reputation. He tells her that Alfredo’s sister’s marriage is in 
                    jeopardy because of their scandalous relationship. Violetta is torn between her 
                    love and her sacrifice, but eventually agrees to Germont’s request. She writes 
                    a farewell letter to Alfredo and leaves. Alfredo returns and finds the letter. 
                    He is devastated and vows revenge.
